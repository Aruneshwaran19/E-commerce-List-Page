## Animation Choices

- **Smooth Scroll for Cart Actions:** Used smooth scrolling for adding/removing items from the cart, as well as the "Scroll to Top" button, to provide a smooth, fluid user experience.
- **Toast Notifications:** Added animations to toast notifications when items are added or removed from the cart. These fade in and out smoothly, ensuring the interface feels dynamic without overwhelming the user.
- **Cart Modal Transitions:** The cart modal fades in when opened and fades out when closed, giving a polished and professional look to the cart interactions.
- **Product Grid Loading Animation:** A loading spinner appears when products are being loaded, followed by a smooth fade-in effect for the product cards once the content is ready.
